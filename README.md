# Breast_Cancer_Detection

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Tumours have become a commmon occurence, courtesy of the modern lifestyle, but not all tumours maybe cancerous, 
and an ML project helping doctors making an accurate prediction may help women all around the world to save themselves 
from the pain and cost of a biopsy


## Background

Around 2.3 million were found with tumour, but only 3-6% of those tumours are malignant, thus a lot of stress and worry can be
averted by the existence of a realiable prediction model


## How is it used?
It will be coded in python.
The database provided by the open source platform, Kaggle, will serve as training data.
Depending upon various factors and correalations, differenent algorithms, such as Linear Regression, XRG Classifier, etc may be applied.


## Challenges
The project does require the doctor to input a lot of data, the predictions may not be able to serve as accurate medical diagnosis 
and patients may still opt for a biopsy, wanting to be absolutely sure

## What next?
I would need a bigger database, with real time updates to be able to modidy the prediction further, 
a user friendly interface may be able to help doctors use this more efficiently, 
after gaining more accurate predictions, an official certification about the model's accuracy may help
uplift the confidence of the patients
